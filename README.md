# Email Scraper

Takes a csv as input for search terms, checks google page for emails, outputs as txt file with found emails.

## Running

Edit parameters at top of `main.js` then run in terminal: `python main.js` (or `python3 main.js`).

Make sure you use python version 3.6 or above. Python 3.9 works best.
